 <h1>General Overview</h1>   
 <p>There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for information.</p>
 <br>
 <a href="https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html">by Subject</a>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use.</p>
 <a href="https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html">by Type</a>
 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for.<p>
 <p>If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list. See also: <a href="https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">About the W3 project</a>.</p>
